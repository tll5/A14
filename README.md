a)	Description of cookie process and how they can be utilized to store information
	Internet cookies are text files that serve as messages passed through web browser usage from a web server. 
  Each of these messages (files) essentially serve as a unique identifier and passer of personal user data 
  that is stored from users giving that information on a particular website. Now, these cookies are usually 
  used by websites that would take in user information, such as a login or form to be filled out with some 
  personal credentials. From here, the website a user may be on sends the cookie text file directly to your device’s 
  hard disk. This enables the hosted web server to remember and retroactively track information about who each user 
  is and other information unique to that user and shutting down once it is stored on the user’s device. Cookies 
  then allow subsequent website visits to store that information as well as present it to the user, making the site 
  that much more interactive. 

b)	Positive and negative aspect of cookies.
Positive aspects:
-	Cookies are a relatively easy method of saving user data since they are placed on the user’s device and do not require any action from the web server when off the website.
-	Cookies smoothen the website experience for a user by prompting them with user specific data that personalizes the website/server for them. 

Negative aspects:
-	Depending on the type of cookie, it can permanently store personal data and the usage of that private data is not clear. 
-	Vulnerabilities exist through the fact that Cookies can be exploited, since plain text cannot be easily encrypted when users visit potentially dangerous or unknown websites. 
-	Also depending on the type of browser accessibility and potential, cookies can be refused or may not work optimally when tracking your personal information.

c)	Is the use of cookies ethical?
Overall, I see the use of cookies as unethical because much of their processes and parameters revolve around third-party advertisers 
and outside resources having indirect access to users’ data inputs. Although most users willingly enter their data and accept cookies 
when visiting a website (especially with many not even knowing what it means), I believe that the different potential vulnerabilities 
should be made known to users so that they fully understand what occurs when cookies are accepted. As users on any given web server or 
site, we truly do not know to what extent how our data is used, but we do know that it is not very well protected in many cases. 
Therefore, the processes that cookies perform are unethical since they store on our device and provide our data to advertisers that would 
benefit from knowing our preferences and other pertinent information, all while we may not fully know who holds the data that we enter 
on a given website/server.
